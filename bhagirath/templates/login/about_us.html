		<p class="heading">About Project Bhagiratha<p>
		<p class="info">The river Ganga has been of prime significance in Indian mythology. Many Indians believe that the waters of Ganga can provide spiritual upliftment.
		   The mythological King Bhagiratha is credited to have been responsible for bringing Ganga to earth after deep penance. We too intend to bring upliftment
		   to many Indians through our project Bhagiratha.</br>However, our belief is that true upliftment of the masses can only occur via education and removal of ignorance.
		   Given the history of the world, many of today’s knowledge repositories remain inaccessible to large sections of the Indian society (on account of 
		   insufficient knowhow about English, and often also due to lack of poor communication infrastructure.)</br>In this project, we undertake an ambitious effort to 
		   translate the Wikipedia into Indian language through a combination of machine learning and crowd sourcing.
		   It took Bhagiratha 1000 years of hard prayer to bring river Ganga to earth. Now YOU can bring the world’s knowledge to India by just translating 4 sentences every day.

		   Total number of Wikipedia articles in English = 3.6 million articles</br>
		   Total number of Wikipedia articles in Hindi = 0.1 million articles</br>
		   Approximate number of sentences in a Wikipedia article = 100 sentences</br>
		   Total number of sentences to be translated = 360 million</br>
		</p>
		<p class="info">
		   If 1 million users translate four sentences each every day, we can translate whole of Wikipedia in Hindi in 3 months!

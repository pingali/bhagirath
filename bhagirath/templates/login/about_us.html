		<p class="name">Shirish Karande</p>
		<p class="info">Shirish wanted to be a cricket scorer but landed up  getting a Ph.D. instead.  His interests can be broadly described as  applications of maching 
		learning and information sciences.  He is currently involved in a couple of  India centric human computation and augmented reality initiatives. Previously, he has
		contributed to the areas of signal/image processing, wireless networks and energy management.
		He got his Ph.D. from Michigan State University and has since worked at University of California- Santa Cruz, Philips Research and TRDDC. He hopes to someday get back to the
		world of academia to work on some combination of AI and computational biology.</p>
		<p class="name">Venkata Pingali</p>
		<p class="info">Venkata is a scientist at TRDDC. His primary background is in Internet protocols and architecture. His emerging technical interests include bigdata and human 
		computation. Outside work he is mainly interested in the intersection of politics, economics, and history. He has spent several years volunteering for a global education non-profit,
		which made him acutely aware of the need for quality educational content in local languages, and motivated his participation in Bhagiratha. </p>
		<p class="name">Srinivasan Iyengar</p>
		<p class="info">Srinivasan is a researcher at Tata Research Development and Design Centre. His current areas of interest include machine learning and crowd sourcing.
		 Earlier he was active in developing products and creating valuable IP in the data privacy space. When not caught in deadlines, he likes to develop theories with not-so
		 concrete proofs on human behavior, luck and hard word. His hobbies include star gazing (He can name more than 100 constellations!), reading (only interesting stuff. No
		 special preference for any genre) and spending time in coffee shops thinking on the next big idea :) He completed his Bachelor's degree in Technology (Computer Science)
		 from College of Engineering, Pune.</p>
		 <p class="name">Sachin Lodha</p>
		<p class="info">Sachin is the founder head of the Applied Algorithms and Optimization (AAO) Group in TCS Innovation Labs - TRDDC. The groupÂ’s current focus includes 
		problems pertaining to data privacy, data center transformation and workforce management. Their researches have generated many patents, peer reviewed publications, 
		and manifested into useful products that are acting as strong differentiators and off-shoring enablers for TCS business. 
		Sachin graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, India, in 1996 and received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Rutgers University, New Jersey, USA, 
		in 2002. He is also a recreational math enthusiast.</p>
		<p class="name">Ankita Jain</p>
		<p class="info">Ankita is Bachelors of Technology (Information Technology) student at College of Engineering, Pune. Striving for perfection is a habit that she finds difficult to get rid of. Hence, rigor in programming comes naturally. But she is a creative person at heart as she often dabbles in artistic endeavors. With an insatiable thirst for knowledge, she has plans to pursue higher education in Computer Science. </p>
		<p class="name">Bhagyashree Gujar</p>
		<p class="info">A design enthusiast, Bhagyashree Gujar, a Computer Engineering graduate from College of Engineering, Pune, excels at everything ranging from
		programming to designing. In her relentless pursuit of integrating aesthetics with technology, she still finds time for extracurricular activities like basketball and
		dancing. Her management skills as the Design Lead for MindSpark'11 and College Magazine'11 have been a constant source of inspiration for others. </p>
		<p class="name">Reena Kabra</p>
		<p class="info">A Computer Engineering graduate from College of Engineering, Pune, Reena Kabra is extremely passionate about programming. In her leisure time she 
		enjoys reading and listening to music. Apart from academics she always finds time for creative side of things. She has also managed technical festival organized in
		her college. When it comes to new projects, her thirst of keeping pace with the new technologies is what seperates her from other.  </p>

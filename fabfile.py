fabfile for Django
------------------
see http://morethanseven.net/2009/07/27/fabric-django-git-apache-mod_wsgi-virtualenv-and-p/

modified for fabric 0.9/1.0 by Hraban (fiëé visuëlle)
several additions, corrections and customizations, too

!!! OBSOLETE WARNING
this is now superseded by my generic django project:
http://github.com/fiee/generic_django_project
including a heavily enhanced fabfile
!!!

This fabric file makes setting up and deploying a Django application much
easier, but it does make a few assumptions. Namely that you're using Git,
Apache and `mod_wsgi` and you're using Debian or Ubuntu. Also you should have 
Django installed on your local machine and SSH installed on both the local
machine and any servers you want to deploy to.

_note that I've used the name project_name throughout this example. Replace
this with whatever your project is called._

First step is to create your project locally:

    mkdir project_name
    cd project_name
    django-admin.py startproject project_name

Now add a requirements file so pip knows to install Django. You'll probably
add other required modules in here later. Create a file called `requirements.txt`
and save it at the top level with the following contents:

    Django

(Add other requirements at will, e.g. django-tinymce)
    
Then save this `fabfile.py` file (this gist!) in the top level directory
which should give you:
    
    project_name/
        fabfile.py
        requirements.txt
        project_name/
            __init__.py
            manage.py
            settings.py
            urls.py

You'll need a WSGI file called `django.wsgi`. It will probably look 
like the following, depending on your specific paths and the location
of your settings module

    import os
    import sys

    # put the Django project on sys.path
    sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))))

    os.environ["DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE"] = "project_name.settings"

    from django.core.handlers.wsgi import WSGIHandler
    application = WSGIHandler()

Last but not least you'll want a virtualhost file for apache which looks 
something like the following. Save this as `vhost.conf` in the inner directory.
You'll want to change `/path/to/project_name/` to the location on the remote
server you intent to deploy to.

	<VirtualHost *:80>
	    ServerName      www.project_name.com
	    ServerAlias     project_name.example.com # temporary location
	
	    # disable listing and "guessing" of static files
	    <Directory /var/www/>
	            Options -Indexes FollowSymLinks -MultiViews
	            AllowOverride None
	            Order deny,allow
	            Allow from all
	    </Directory>
	    
	    Alias /favicon.ico /var/www/project_name/releases/current/project_name/static/favicon.ico
	    
	    # project media
	    Alias /media /var/www/project_name/releases/current/project_name/static
	    <Location "/media">
	            SetHandler None
	    </Location>
	
	    # general admin media
	    Alias /django_admin_media /var/www/project_name/lib/python2.5/site-packages/django/contrib/admin/media
	    <Location "/django_admin_media">
	            SetHandler None
	    </Location>
	
		WSGIDaemonProcess project_name-production user=project_name group=project_name threads=10 python-path=/var/www/project_name/lib/python2.5/site-packages:/var/www/python
		WSGIProcessGroup project_name-production
		WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/project_name/releases/current/django.wsgi
	
		ErrorLog /var/www/project_name/logs/error.log
		LogLevel warn
		CustomLog /var/www/project_name/logs/access.log combined
	</VirtualHost>

Now create a file called `.gitignore`, containing the following. This
prevents the compiled python code being included in the repository and
the archive we use for deployment. (Add more that you don't want to
publish, e.g. your local settings and development database.)

    *.pyc
    *.pyo
    .tmp*

E.g. here's my default `.gitignore` file:

    *.pyc
    *.pyo
    .tmp*
    .DS_Store
    .project
    .pydevproject
    .settings
    .svn
    secret.txt
    settings_local.py
    dev.db
    build
    *.tar.gz
    *.bak

You should now be ready to initialise a git repository in the top
level project_name directory.

    git init
    git add .gitignore *
    git commit -m "Initial commit"

All of that should leave you with 
    
    project_name/
        .git/
        .gitignore
        requirements.txt
        fabfile.py
        project_name/
            __init__.py
            project_name
            django.wsgi
            manage.py
            settings.py
            urls.py

In reality you might prefer to keep your wsgi files and virtual host files
elsewhere. The fabfile has a variable (config.virtualhost_path) for this case. 
You'll also want to set the hosts that you intend to deploy to (config.hosts)
as well as the user (config.user).

The first task we're interested in is called setup. It installs all the 
required software on the remote machine, then deploys your code and restarts
the webserver.

    fab local setup

_note: Since you can't properly setup the required user and database via fab anyway, 
it may be better to comment the lines calling aptitude._

Here's what I do to create user and database:
(I re-activated the wheel group for sudo-enabled users. That's a potential security risk!)

    adduser --ingroup wheel project_name
    mysql -u root -p
    create user 'project_name'@'localhost' identified by 'password';
    create database proejct_name character set 'utf-8';
    use project_name;
    grant all privileges on project_name.* to 'project_name'@'localhost';
    quit;

After you've made a few changes and commit them to the master Git branch you 
can run to deploy the changes.
    
    fab local deploy

If something is wrong then you can rollback to the previous version.

    fab local rollback
    
Note that this only allows you to rollback to the release immediately before
the latest one. If you want to pick a arbitrary release then you can use the
following, where 20090727170527 is a timestamp for an existing release.

    fab local deploy_version:20090727170527

If you want to ensure your tests run before you make a deployment then you can 
do the following.

    fab local test deploy
